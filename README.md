Raw extracted data is processed using Python to flatten nested JSON structures and arrays into normalized table format.

### Load - SQL Server Integration
   
Processed data is loaded into appropriate layers in SQL Server.


## üóÇÔ∏è Entity Relationship Diagram

![Entity Relationship Diagram](docs/data_relations.png)

### The star schema consists of:

* **fact_orders:** Central fact table containing order transactions and metrics
* **dim_customers:** Customer dimension with detailed customer information
* **dim_products:** Product dimension with product specifications and attributes
* **dim_reviews:** Review dimension containing product reviews and ratings

### Key relationships:

* Each order in **fact_orders** references a customer through `customer_id`
* Each order line references a product through `product_id`
* Reviews are linked to both customers and products for comprehensive analysis

## üîç Data Quality and Validation

Comprehensive data quality checks are implemented across both silver and gold layers to ensure data integrity and consistency. The validation process includes duplicate detection, referential integrity verification, business rule validation (such as price and quantity constraints), and format compliance checks for fields like SKUs, emails, and URLs. These quality assurance measures guarantee that the data warehouse maintains high standards of accuracy and reliability throughout the ETL pipeline.

## Products and Reviews

* **Product Portfolio and Overall Performance:** The analysis reveals a well-diversified portfolio with 194 products across 24 categories and 64 different brands. The gap between expected rating (3.80) and actual rating (3.69) of -0.11 indicates that customer expectations are generally being met, though there's room for fine-tuning performance.

* **Category Sales Distribution and Opportunities:** Kitchen-Accessories leads with 30 units sold, followed by Groceries (27 units), forming the core of successful categories. Sports-Accessories (17) and Smartphones (16) show moderate performance with growth potential. The lowest-performing categories are Women's Jewelery, Tablets, and Skin-Care, indicating either market saturation or product-market fit issues that require strategic attention.

* **Critical Stock Issues:** The inventory situation shows mixed challenges across product demand levels: Samsung Galaxy S8, Sportbike Motorcycle, and Volleyball Watch are completely out of stock (0 units) after selling 3, 2, and 10 units respectively. Meanwhile, other products face low stock situations - Apple Airpower and Apple MagSafe Battery Pack maintain only 1 unit each despite selling 1 and 7 units. This indicates inadequate demand forecasting across different product tiers, with both stockout and low-stock scenarios affecting sales potential.

* **Rating Performance and Customer Dissatisfaction:** Of the 133 different products sold, 62 products have received ratings below their expected levels which reveals widespread quality concerns affecting nearly half the product portfolio, indicating systemic quality issues. To give an example, products with IDs 5, 6, and 11 show severe rating gaps with expected ratings of 4.32-4.77 versus actual ratings of only 2.00.

* **Inventory Management Challenges:** Multiple overstocked items are consuming valuable storage space and tying up working capital. Products like Heshe Women's Leather Bag (99 units in stock), Durango SXT (95 units), RWD Feather Shuttlecock (95 units), and Men Check Shirt (95 units) represent slow-moving inventory with poor sales velocity. These products are generating minimal turnover while occupying substantial warehouse capacity. Price adjustments and discount strategies may need to be considered for these overstocked items to improve inventory flow and free up storage resources.
